## Overview
This project could be separated to three parts.  
1. The first part is microcontroller Renesas RX62T;  
2. The second part is the robot be controlled by 10 motors;  
3. The last part is computing engine (laptop) connected to Kinect;  

All motors is be controlled by microcontroller through PWM.  
The microcontroller communicates to PC via RS232.
